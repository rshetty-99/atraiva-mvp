## Executive Summary

**Company:** Wojeski & Company

**Industry:** Accounting

**Incident Date:** July 28, 2023

**Regulator:** New York Attorney General Letitia James

## What Happened

On July 28, 2023, employees at Wojeski & Company, a certified public accounting firm, discovered they were locked out of their systems—a telltale sign of a ransomware attack. The investigation revealed that a phishing email sent to one of their employees had compromised the network, giving attackers access to sensitive client data.

The breach investigation uncovered a critical security failure: customers' Social Security Numbers were stored unencrypted across parts of the company's network. While the firm worked to contain the initial breach, a second incident occurred on May 31, 2024, when an employee from a firm hired to help with the breach investigation improperly accessed customer data and sent it to several external email addresses without authorization.

### Timeline

- **July 28, 2023** - Ransomware attack detected when employees couldn't access files
- **May 31, 2024** - Second data breach by investigation contractor
- **November 2024** - Customers finally notified (16 months after first breach)
- **October 20, 2025** - $60,000 settlement announced by NY Attorney General

## Data Exposed

The breach exposed the following types of personal information:

- Social Security Numbers (unencrypted)
- Names and dates of birth
- Driver's license numbers
- Email addresses and phone numbers
- Financial account numbers
- Medical benefits information
- Entitlement information

The 2023 breach affected 5,881 individuals (4,726 New York residents), and the 2024 breach affected 351 individuals (267 New York residents).

## Violations & Failures

The investigation by the New York Attorney General's Office revealed multiple security and compliance failures:

### Technical Failures

- **No Encryption**: Social Security Numbers and other sensitive data were stored in plain text without encryption, violating basic data security standards
- **Phishing Vulnerability**: Employees lacked adequate training to recognize and report phishing emails, the #1 cause of ransomware attacks
- **Poor Vendor Management**: The firm hired to help investigate the breach had improper access to customer data and no adequate oversight
- **Weak Access Controls**: Employees and contractors had excessive access to sensitive information without proper authentication or monitoring

### Compliance Failures

- **Massive Notification Delay**: Wojeski took over a year and a half (16 months) to notify customers of the breach, far exceeding New York's requirement for prompt notification
- **Inadequate Incident Response**: The company lacked a proper incident response plan, leading to confusion and delays in containment and notification

## Penalties & Consequences

### Financial Penalties

- **Total Settlement**: $60,000
- **Credit Monitoring**: One year of free credit report monitoring for all affected individuals

### Required Remediation Measures

As part of the settlement, Wojeski & Company must implement the following security measures:

1. **Comprehensive Security Program**: Maintain a comprehensive information security program to protect the security, integrity, and confidentiality of customer information
2. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt all personal information that the company collects, stores, transmits, and/or maintains
3. **Data Inventory**: Develop and maintain an inventory of where personal data is stored within its network
4. **Access Controls**: Maintain reasonable account management and authentication processes that limit employees' access to sensitive information as necessary
5. **Vulnerability Management**: Establish a program designed to identify and correct security vulnerabilities within its computer network
6. **Incident Response Plan**: Implement an incident response plan ensuring timely notice to consumers
7. **Employee Training**: Implement a cybersecurity training program to be completed by all employees

## Key Takeaways for Your Business

### 1. Encrypt Everything—Especially Social Security Numbers

The failure to encrypt Social Security Numbers was a critical vulnerability that directly contributed to this settlement. Encryption is not optional—it's a legal requirement in most states and a fundamental security control. If attackers access your encrypted data, it's essentially worthless to them.

**Action**: Audit your systems today. If any SSNs, financial data, or health information isn't encrypted both at rest and in transit, prioritize fixing this immediately.

### 2. Employee Training Prevents 90% of Breaches

This breach started with a single phishing email. One employee clicking one malicious link gave attackers the keys to the kingdom. Regular security awareness training and phishing simulations are not just best practices—they're essential business continuity measures.

**Action**: Implement quarterly phishing simulations and annual security training for all employees. Track completion rates and retrain employees who fall for simulated attacks.

### 3. Notification Delays Compound Penalties

Wojeski's 16-month delay in notifying customers turned a bad situation into a costly settlement. New York law requires businesses to notify affected individuals "in the most expeditious time possible and without unreasonable delay." Most states require notification within 30-60 days of discovering a breach.

**Action**: Document your breach notification procedures now. Know exactly who to notify, when, and how. Template your notification letters in advance.

### 4. Vendor Management is Your Responsibility

The second breach—caused by a vendor hired to help with the first breach—demonstrates that third-party risk is your risk. When you give vendors access to customer data, you're responsible for their security practices.

**Action**: Conduct security assessments of all vendors with data access. Include security requirements in contracts. Monitor vendor activity and limit access to only what's necessary.

## Industry-Specific Implications

**For Accounting Firms:** This case sends a clear message that accounting firms, despite handling sensitive financial data daily, are being held to the same high standards as financial institutions. The Attorney General specifically noted that "as an accounting firm, Wojeski should have taken stronger measures to protect New Yorkers' personal data."

Key considerations for accounting firms:

- **Tax Season Risk**: The concentration of sensitive data during tax season makes you a prime target
- **Client Trust**: Your clients trust you with their most sensitive financial information—a breach can destroy your reputation
- **Professional Liability**: Beyond regulatory penalties, you face potential malpractice claims
- **Small Firm Challenges**: Don't assume "too small to hack"—attackers often target small firms with valuable data and weak security

## State-Specific Requirements

This incident occurred in New York. Key state-specific requirements include:

- **Notification Timeline**: New York requires notification in the "most expeditious time possible and without unreasonable delay." While not a specific number of days, 16 months is clearly unreasonable.
- **Required Notices**: Affected individuals, Attorney General (if more than 500 NY residents), and consumer reporting agencies must be notified
- **Penalties**: New York can impose penalties up to $5,000 per violation, plus investigation costs and restitution
- **SHIELD Act**: New York's SHIELD Act requires reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, including encryption of private information

> **Important:** Breach notification laws vary by state. Companies must understand requirements in all states where affected individuals reside. If you have customers in multiple states, you must comply with each state's notification law.
