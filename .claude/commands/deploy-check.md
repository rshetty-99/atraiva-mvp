2. **security-engineer**: Conducts security audit and vulnerability assessment  
3. **compliance-officer**: Ensures HIPAA compliance and regulatory adherence
4. **performance-optimizer**: Validates performance metrics and optimization

## Process
The command coordinates validation agents to:
- Validate secure deployment infrastructure
- Conduct comprehensive security and vulnerability assessment
- Ensure HIPAA and healthcare regulatory compliance
- Verify performance optimization and scalability readiness

## Output
Deployment readiness report with security clearance, compliance validation, and performance metrics.
